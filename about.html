		<p>Hi! I’m Maangchi! Welcome to my website!</p>

		<p>I was born and raised in Korea and have been interested in cooking and food since I was a little girl. I live in New York City now, and love to learn about food from other cultures, too. On April 9 2007, I posted a video of myself cooking Korean food on YouTube, just for fun. Right away, people were interested in it, so I’ve been making them ever since.</p>

		<p>I made this website to share my knowledge and for Korean food lovers worldwide who want to talk to each other and share advice, photos, tips and tricks.</p>

		<p>I stick to authentic Korean recipes because that’s what I was raised on and that’s what I know. But I’m always interested in learning new techniques and I’m constantly experimenting and developing and reworking my own recipes. Whenever I make something good, I’ll post it here!</p>

		<p>I’m blessed to have met so many wonderful people through YouTube and my website. Meeting with and talking to my viewers and readers is so much fun: they are all passionate cooks and have a lot of knowledge and funny stories to share.</p>

		<p>Thanks for your interest in my recipes, and take care!</p>
