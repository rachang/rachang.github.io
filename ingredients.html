		<p>Over the years I’ve had many requests to make a section of my website for cooks who are just starting to learn about Korean food and ingredients. Some people are really interested in learning Korean cooking but have no idea where to start. Some of them have never even tasted Korean food! They’ve seen it in Korean dramas which has made them interested in trying it. Making Korean food at home is the best way to learn what it's all about. Also, your family members and friends will be very happy to taste your food. They will be impressed that you could learn how to make delicious food all by yourself. I hope you find this guide useful. I will continue adding new sections to it as I write them. Happy cooking!</p>
